CMDS:
npm init
npm i express
npm i
npm i -g nodemon

=====> DevDependencies [dependencies while development]
->npm install --save -dev nodemon [nodemon just during development]
->npm uninstall nodemon 
->npm uninstall express
->npm install angular/cli


=====>Imports
const student = require("./second");
=====>Module Wrapper
(function (exports,require, module, __filename, __dirnamr){
  _code here_
})
common JS (CJS) Modules VS Ecma script Modules (ECM)s



=====>NodeJS working process
Event Loop{
|--->CallStack-------->|  (it registers all functions inside it before execution of them)
|    NodeAPI           |  (if any function dont relates to core JS then it will first come to NodeAPI then it will send to Callback Queue -> Like TimeOut function is not part of JS it is part of C++)
|<---Callback Queue <--|  (the NodeApi functions will remain in callbackQueue untill the main function is present in callStack then they will sent to CallStack->so this is waiting area )
}

=====>EXPRESS JS
npm install express

=====>EJS Routing (embeded js)
npm install ejs
